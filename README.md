### Description and Functionalities:

<p>COVID Hub is a web application where users access an array of covid related information and services. Once logged in, the user can access settings to 1. Receive COVID related data and analytics by email 2. Receive simple COVID related information by text (e.g. daily cases and deaths) 3. Filter a COVID news feed on their dashboard and 4. Get matched with other users who are looking to give or receive COVID related services (e.g. Grocery delivery). This type of service adds to the social good since people can be better informed on COVID and help others in their area. It also has the added benefit that these services are all on one platform. We plan on implementing an event-driven microservices architecture so that services can be more easily added or removed.</p>
